            <p> My name is Bosco. I like playing games on my PC. It makes me feel I am on top of the world!
                I am learning how to make fun games to help people have fun too. The world has become
                crazy and chaotic! We need some free time to play.</p>
            <p>In the end, that is what makes life more fullfilling. Not boring! Finally, I like to wish people joy and
                success. It makes me happy when y'all happy.</p>
            <p id="quote">This is my awesome quote from Stewart B. Johnston: "Our business in life is not to get ahead
                of others but to get ahead of ourselves-to break our own records, <br> to outstrip our yesterdays by
                our today, to do our work with more force than ever before."</p>

            <p>This quote from Steve Jobs also resonate with me very well: “One way to remember who you are is to
                remember who your heroes are.”
                “If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You
                have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the
                outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which
                is why a lot of times, artists have to say, “Bye. I have to go. I’m going crazy and I’m getting out of
                here.” And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently. (Steve
                Jobs)”
                That is exactly the kind of mentality I have, when CSS tries to mess up with me! </p>
